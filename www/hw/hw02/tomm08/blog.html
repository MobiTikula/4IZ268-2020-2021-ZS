                <p><strong>What exactly is cold brew coffee? 
                </strong></p>
                <p><em>This mellow drink is made of filter ground coffee and cold water. Yes, cold! Usually we extract the flavours from coffee by using heat of the water. Now that the water is cold, we use time instead to get the extraction going. Usually that is 12-16 h. As a result we will get less acidic and pretty sweet coffee. </em>
