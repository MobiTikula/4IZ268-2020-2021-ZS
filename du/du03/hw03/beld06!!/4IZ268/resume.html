    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Early life: Sm√©agol spent the early years of his life living with his extended family under a Matriarch</li>
        <li>Life under the Misty Mountains: He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small row boat), bats and small Goblins when he could get them. </li>
        <li>Search for the Ring: Gollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years later, but the trail was cold. He made his way south into Mordor where all evil was being drawn at the time</li>
        <li>Death: The ring was burned in the molten lava with Gollum consumed with it as well.</li>
