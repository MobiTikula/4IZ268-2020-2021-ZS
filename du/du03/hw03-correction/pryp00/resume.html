    <p>Nicolas Kim Coppola born January 7, 1964. Known professionally as Nicolas Cage, is an American actor and
        filmmaker. Cage has been nominated for numerous major cinematic awards, and won an Academy Award, a Golden
        Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas (1995).During his early career,
        Cage starred in a variety of films such as Rumble Fish, Valley Girl, etc.</p>
    <h2>Early life and family</h2>
    <p>Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to August Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a
        dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother
        was of German and Polish ancestry. Through his father, he is a nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and of
        actress Talia Shire, and the cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo
        Coppola, and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman.</p>
    <p>Cage's two brothers are New York radio personality Marc "The Cope" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He
        attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to
        act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic
        acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy. He said he started acting because he "wanted to be
        James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause, East of Eden. Nothing affected me—no rock song, no classical
        music—the way Dean affected me in Eden. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'."</p>
    <p>At fifteen years old he tried to convince his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, to give him a screen test, telling him
        "I'll show you acting." His outburst was met with "silence in the car".[13] By this stage of his career, Coppola
        had already directed Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman and Robert De Niro. To avoid the appearance of
        nepotism as Coppola's nephew, he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage, inspired in part by the
        Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Since his film debut with a minor role in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, opposite Judge Reinhold and Sean Penn,
        Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat. He auditioned for the role of Dallas
        Winston in his uncle's film <i>The Outsiders</i>, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon.[15] He
        was also in Coppola's films <i>Rumble Fish</i> and <i>Peggy Sue Got Married</i>.</p>
