                <h2>Early Life and Parents</h2>
                <p>Hailing from London, Cumberbatch was born with theater in his blood. His parents, Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, were well-known television actors when they had their son on July 19, 1976. Despite their success, they tried to steer young Benedict away from the stage and sent him to Harrow public school, where he had been awarded an arts scholarship.</p>
                <p>At Harrow, he displayed an interest in rugby and painting, but it was theater that captured his imagination. Under the mentorship of Martin Tyrrell, Cumberbatch's first role was as Titania, Queen of the Faeries, in <a href="https://www.biography.com/writer/william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s<em>A Midsummer's Night Dream</em>.</p>
                <p>Cumberbatch went on to teach English in Tibet, before returning to England to study drama at the University of Manchester. After graduation, he spent a year at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.</p>
