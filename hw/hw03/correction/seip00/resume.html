        <h1>Life cycle of a mighty CPU</h1>
        <p>This mighty CPU powered a gaming rig for whole 6 years before it got replaced. You can clearly see what a
            powerful beast it was. It has been seated in a Z77 motherboard which allowed overclocking and it ran @4.2GHz
            for about 3 years before something happened.</p>
        <h2>Deliding</h2>
        <p>The cpu just wasn't able to go higher than 4.2GHz without needing lots of voltage which resulted in high
            temperatures. So, it came to deliding. Cpu got separated from its IHS and the awful TIM was replaced with
            liguid metal with much higher thermal conductivity</p>

        <p>In the picture above you can see the bare die with CPU in the middle and IHS beneath it. After replacing TIM
            with liquid metal, temps dropped significantly, which only meant one thing. Pushing the CPU to it's newly
            unlocked limits. It has achieved impressive 4.5GHz at just 1.22V and the boost it gave to the whole system,
            was enough to last another 2 years. Sadly in 2020 the technology progressed so much, that this cpu's
            performace just wasn't up to the task and it had to be replaced. </p>
