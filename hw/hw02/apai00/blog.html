        <h2>Different between HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
        <h4>HTTP</h4>
        <p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. When you enter http:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it tells the browser to connect over HTTP. HTTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), generally over port 80, to send and receive data packets over the web. To put it simply it is a protocol that's used by a client and server which allows you to communicate with other websites. The client sends a request message to an HTTP server (after the TCP handshake) which hosts a website, the server then replies with the response message. The response message contains completion status information, such as HTTP/1.1 200 OK.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HTTPS</h4>
        <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL). When you enter https:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it tells the browser to connect over HTTPS. Generally sites running over HTTPS will have a redirect in place so even if you type in http:// it will redirect to deliver over a secured connection. HTTPS also uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to send and receive data packets, but it does so over port 443, within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p>

        <h4>Different?</h4>
        <p>HTTP URL in your browser's address bar is http:// and the HTTPS URL is https://.</p>
        <p>HTTP is unsecured while HTTPS is secured.</p>
        <p>HTTP sends data over port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443.</p>
        <p>HTTP operates at application layer, while HTTPS operates at transport layer.</p>
        <p>No SSL certificates are required for HTTP, with HTTPS it is required that you have an SSL certificate and it is signed by a CA.</p>
        <p>HTTP doesn't require domain validation, where as HTTPS requires at least domain validation and certain certificates even require legal document validation.</p>
        <p>No encryption in HTTP, with HTTPS the data is encrypted before sending</p>
