        <section>
            <h3>1979- 1987: Early work</h3>
            <p>In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film<em> He Knows You're Alone (1980)</em> and landed a starring role in the television movie <em> Mazes and Monsters</em>. </p>

                <h3>1988- 2003: Established star</h3>
                <p>The broad success of the fantasy comedy <em>Big (1988)</em> established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor.</p>
                <p>
                    Hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: <em>The 'Burbs (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)</em>.
                </p>
                <hr></hr>
                <h4>Philidelphia</h4>
                <p>
                    This "modern era" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle and then with Philadelphia.
                    In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for "People" magazine, Leah Rozen stated, <em>"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar."</em> Hanks won the 1993 <strong>Academy Award for Best Actor</strong> for his role in Philadelphia.     
                </p>
                <hr></hr>
                <h4>Forrest Gump</h4>
                <p>
                    Hanks followed Philadelphia with the 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: <em>"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do."</em> Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive <strong>Best Actor Oscars.</strong>
